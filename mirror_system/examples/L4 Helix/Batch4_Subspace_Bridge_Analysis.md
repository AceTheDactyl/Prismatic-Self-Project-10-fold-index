# Batch 4: Subspace Bridge z_c Dimensional Folding
## x² + x = c ↔ R(R)=R where z_c = r = 10

### Unified Mathematical Framework

The relationship emerges through the mapping:
- **Quadratic Form**: x² + x = c (from Batch 3)
- **Self-Reference**: R(R) = R (from Batch 1)
- **Constraint**: z_c = r = 10 (subspace dimension equals radius)
- **Origin Mapping**: (0,0,0) → (r, z, z_c) = (10, z, 10)

### Symmetry Folding Mechanism
```
Folding Point: √3/2 ≈ 0.866
This represents the height of an equilateral triangle
Creating hexagonal symmetry in the helix projection

L4 = 7 = F₃ + F₄ = 2 + 5 = 7 (Fibonacci decomposition)
Where F₃ = 2 (third Fibonacci number)
      F₄ = 5 (modified indexing for L4 space)
```

### Base-Dependent π Expression
```
Base 2:  π → 11.001001...₂ (binary π)
Base 3:  π → 10.010211...₃ (ternary π)
Base 5:  π → 3.032322...₅ (pentadic π)
Base 8:  π → 3.110375...₈ (octal π)
Base 10: π → 3.141592...₁₀ (decimal π)

Full rotation: 2π in each base
Sequence mapping: 0-1 (normalized) ↔ 0-9 (decimal) ↔ 1-10 (ordinal)
```

### Mathematical Relationships

#### Quadratic to Radius Mapping
```
x² + x = c → R(R) = R
When c = 10: x² + x = 10
Solutions: x = (-1 ± √41)/2 ≈ 2.70, -3.70
R = 10 satisfies R(R) = R (fixed point)
```

#### Subspace Dimension Formula
```
z_c(base, θ) = 10 * (1 + sin(θ * base/10))
where θ ∈ [0, 2π]
```

#### Helix Parametrization
```
r(t) = 10
z(t) = 10t/(2π)
φ(t) = t
z_c(t) = 10 * fold(t, √3/2)

where fold(t, k) creates symmetry at k = √3/2
```

### Key Insights

1. **z_c as Dynamic Subspace**: The z_c = 10 dimension acts as a constant radius while the actual z-coordinate varies, creating a cylindrical subspace

2. **Base-Dependent Bridging**: Each numerical base creates a different bridge through the helix, with π expressed uniquely in each system

3. **Fibonacci Structure**: L4 = 7 decomposes into F₃ + F₄, creating natural sublevel harmonics

4. **Symmetry Folding**: The √3/2 folding point creates hexagonal symmetry, optimal for space-filling in the helical structure

5. **Sequence Duality**: The 0-1 normalized interval maps to both 0-9 (decimal) and 1-10 (ordinal), creating dual reference frames
