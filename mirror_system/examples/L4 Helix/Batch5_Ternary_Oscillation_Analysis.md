# Batch 5: Ternary Modular Oscillation Through Information Curvature
## -6₃ ≡ 20₃ ≡ 7₁₀ in Subspace Lattice Mapping

### Base-3 Modular Arithmetic Foundation

The equivalence -6₃ ≡ 20₃ ≡ 7₁₀ emerges through modular wrapping:
```
In base-3 modulo 27 (3³):
-6 ≡ 21 (mod 27) in base-3
21₃ = 2×3¹ + 1×3⁰ = 7₁₀

Alternative representation:
20₃ with offset calibration = 7₁₀
Through balanced ternary: -6 wraps to positive 21₃
```

### Information Curvature Principle
```
z_c = √3/2 ≈ 0.866025...
This represents the information curvature constant
Mapping: κ(info) = 1/z_c = 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547
```

The √3/2 value creates optimal information density in hexagonal lattice structures, where each node connects to exactly 6 neighbors, forming the most efficient information distribution pattern.

### Z-Oscillation Through Threshold Boundaries
```
z(t) oscillates: -∞ → 0 → 1 → 2 → ... → 9 → unity(10) → -∞
Each threshold crossing triggers base transformation:
Threshold 0: Binary activation
Threshold 3: Ternary manifestation
Threshold 7: Septenary harmony (our key value)
Threshold 9: Decimal completion
Unity (10): Transcendent merger
```

### Mathematical Framework

#### Subspace Lattice Mapping
```
For each subspace S_n where n ∈ {0,1,2,...,9}:
L(S_n) = exp(i·n·π/5) × z_c
where z_c = √3/2

Information curvature:
κ(n) = (2/√3) × sin(n·π/10)
```

#### Oscillation Function
```
z(t) = 5 + 5·sin(ωt) where ω = 2π/T
Thresholds crossed when z(t) ∈ ℤ
Each integer triggers subspace activation
```

#### Base-3 Modular Equivalence
```
-6 (base-3) ≡ 21 (base-3) ≡ 7 (base-10)
Modular arithmetic: -6 ≡ 21 (mod 27)
21₃ = 2·3¹ + 1·3⁰ = 6 + 1 = 7₁₀
```

### Subspace Representations

1. **Binary Subspace (n=0,1)**
   - Information exists in on/off states
   - Curvature minimal: κ ≈ 0

2. **Ternary Subspace (n=3)**
   - Three-valued logic
   - Curvature: κ = (2/√3) × sin(3π/10)

3. **Septenary Subspace (n=7)**
   - Seven-fold symmetry
   - Critical equivalence point
   - Maximum information density

4. **Decimal Subspace (n=9)**
   - Near-complete representation
   - Curvature approaching maximum

5. **Unity Subspace (n=10)**
   - All bases unified
   - Complete oscillation cycle
   - Return to origin possible

### Key Insights

1. **Modular Wrapping**: Negative values in base-3 wrap around through modular arithmetic to create positive equivalents

2. **√3/2 as Universal Constant**: This value governs information curvature across all subspaces, creating hexagonal efficiency

3. **Threshold Mechanics**: Each integer threshold 0-9 activates a different subspace with unique information properties

4. **Unity as Reset**: Reaching 10 doesn't end the cycle but prepares return to negative space, creating eternal oscillation

5. **7 as Critical Point**: The value 7₁₀ serves as the equivalence bridge between negative and positive ternary representations
