# Batch 6: Signal Wave Propagation Through Folding Symmetry
## Explicit & Implicit Rules in z_c Sublattice Closed Structures

### Signal Propagation Framework

Signal propagation occurs at threshold boundaries where wave functions can travel:
- **Backwards**: Retrocausal information flow (t → -t)
- **Forwards**: Standard causal propagation (t → +t)
- **Up/Down to Self**: Self-referential loops creating standing waves

Each direction follows both explicit computational rules and emergent implicit patterns within closed structures of the z_c sublattice where z_c = √3/2.

### Wave Mechanics at Thresholds
```
Forward Wave:  Ψ_f(z,t) = A·exp(i(kz - ωt))
Backward Wave: Ψ_b(z,t) = B·exp(i(kz + ωt))
Self Wave:     Ψ_s(z,t) = C·exp(i·k·z)·cos(ωt)

Threshold activation: |Ψ|² > τ_n where n ∈ {0,1,3,5,7,9,10}
```

### Explicit Rules (Computational)
```
1. Signal amplitude: A = √(2/3) at z_c boundaries
2. Phase velocity: v_p = ω/k = c/n where n = refractive index
3. Group velocity: v_g = dω/dk ≤ c
4. Reflection coefficient: R = |(n₁-n₂)/(n₁+n₂)|²
5. Transmission: T = 1 - R
```

### Implicit Rules (Emergent)
```
1. Spontaneous symmetry breaking at critical thresholds
2. Self-organization into standing wave patterns
3. Quantum interference creating forbidden zones
4. Resonant coupling between closed structures
5. Information entropy minimization paths
```

### Mathematical Framework

#### Wave Superposition in Closed Structures
```
Ψ_total = Ψ_f + Ψ_b + Ψ_s
       = A·exp(i(kz - ωt)) + B·exp(i(kz + ωt)) + C·exp(ikz)·cos(ωt)

At equilibrium: |Ψ_total|² = constant
Creating closed energy loops in z_c sublattice
```

#### Threshold Folding Function
```
Fold(z, τ) = {
  z,           if z < τ
  2τ - z,      if τ ≤ z < 2τ  (folding back)
  z - 2τ,      if z ≥ 2τ      (next period)
}
where τ = n·z_c = n·√3/2 for threshold n
```

#### Explicit Rule Set
```
R1: Wave velocity = c/n(z)
R2: Amplitude decay = exp(-αz)
R3: Phase shift = kz - ωt + φ₀
R4: Energy conservation: ∫|Ψ|²dz = E₀
R5: Reflection at boundaries: R + T = 1
```

#### Implicit Emergent Patterns
```
E1: Spontaneous node formation at √3/2 intervals
E2: Phase locking between forward/backward waves
E3: Information channels self-organize
E4: Minimum action paths emerge
E5: Quantum coherence domains form
```

### Closed Structure Properties

1. **Topological Closure**: Signals returning to origin after complete cycle
2. **Energy Conservation**: Total energy trapped within closed loops
3. **Information Preservation**: No information loss in closed structures
4. **Resonant Frequencies**: f_n = nc/(2L) where L = loop length
5. **Symmetry Groups**: SO(3) rotation symmetry preserved

### Signal Propagation Modes

#### Mode 1: Progressive Wave
- Forward propagation dominates
- Information flows causally
- Explicit rules govern behavior

#### Mode 2: Standing Wave
- Forward + Backward interference
- Energy localized in space
- Implicit patterns emerge

#### Mode 3: Evanescent Wave
- Exponential decay beyond threshold
- Tunneling through forbidden zones
- Quantum effects dominate

#### Mode 4: Self-Referential Loop
- Up/Down circulation
- Information feeds back to source
- Creates computational closure

### z_c Sublattice Architecture
```
Level 0: Ground state (z = 0)
Level 1: First threshold (z = z_c = √3/2)
Level 2: Second threshold (z = 2z_c = √3)
Level 3: Third threshold (z = 3z_c = 3√3/2)
...
Closed at: z = 12z_c (returning to Level 0)
```

### Key Insights

1. **Bidirectional Time**: Backward waves enable retrocausal information flow within closed structures

2. **Folding Symmetry**: At z_c = √3/2, waves fold back creating mirror symmetries

3. **Rule Duality**: Explicit computational rules coexist with emergent implicit patterns

4. **Closed Loops**: Self-referential waves create computational closure in the sublattice

5. **Signal Multiplexing**: Forward, backward, and self waves can coexist in the same space
